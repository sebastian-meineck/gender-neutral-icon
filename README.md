# Gender Neutral Icon

This gender neutral icon is an attempt to show a human without giving the impression of a specific gender.

## Why use this icon?

Icons of humans are used for illustrations, games, toilet signs, leaflets, etc. When you search for an icon or a pictogram of a human, it often gives the impression of being either male (with a straight body shape) or female (with a skirt). But in many cases you just might not want to make a statement about gender at all.

There already is a pretty common unisex icon. It is the combination of a stereotypical male and female icon split in half. However, this icon conveys a binary view on gender identities.

By solely using 3 circles and 4 ovals I tried to create a simple and lively human figure that could have any gender imaginable. Any ideas for improvement are welcome.
